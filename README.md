# Substance Classification Via Personality Trait Information 

Given information regarding an individual's personality traits, can we predict whether they are at risk for using certain substances? 
An in depth analysis on the likelihood of people to use specific substances based on their psychological and emotional makeup.

Accompanying Flask App was built with python, HTML, CSS and jQuery. User may specify their personality trait scores and model(s) will predict the likelihood that the user is at risk for using marijuana, nicotine, or cocaine - separate predictor for each substance.
